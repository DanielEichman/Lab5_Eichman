##Discussion of 1st Program Operation
This program loads 8 into the accumulator then increments it. The value is then outputted onto port 3. If the value is less than 0 it will be incremented again then outputted. If it is greater than 0 the program will enter an infinite loop. The output values are: 9,A,B,C,D,E,F,1 then the program will enter a invite loop.
